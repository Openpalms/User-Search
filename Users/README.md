# Users-Card-Search

Users Cards with backend data coming from server (Also in repository)
Cards are clickable, popup shows. You can close it as you usually do - esc, click outside of element or via button.
Initially, it shows only 10 cards, but server has 50 objects, so you can search whatever you want and be sure everyone will be found.
Cards are responsive.
To test this app, use 'npm start'.
Server should work at 3000 port, so use another port for interface e.g 3001.
